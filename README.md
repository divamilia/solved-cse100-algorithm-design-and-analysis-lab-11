<strong>Binary Search Trees</strong>

In this lab your goal is to implement standard operations on <strong>binary search trees</strong>, including insert and delete. See section 12.3 in the textbook. In this assignment the keys are integers.

The input contains one of the following commands on a line:

<ul>

 <li>i key — Insert key into the BST. For example, “i 2” means “Insert key 2 into the BST”.</li>

 <li>d key — Delete key from the BST. For example, “d 2” means “Delete key 2 from the BST”. Do nothing if the BST does not contain the key.</li>

 <li>pre — Output all keys in preorder.</li>

 <li>post — Output all keys in postorder.</li>

 <li>in — Output all keys in inorder.</li>

 <li>e — Finish your program.</li>

</ul>
